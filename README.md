#Portfolio Project 1 - SQL and PowerBI - AdventureWorks
Welcome to my first portfolio project. In this data cleaning, analysis and visualisation project, I clean the AdventureWorks dataset with SQL, then visualise it as an interactive 3-page dashboard with PowerBI and also export a static version of the dashboard as a PDF.

Project Guide

The 4 CSV data tables are the output of the SQL queries, where I clean the tables by sorting and exporting only those columns which are needed for visualisation in PowerBI.

Once the cleaned data tables have been exported as CSVs, I import the 4 CSVs and the Excel worksheet into PowerBI, where I link the tables together in the "Model" side tab:

 then further process the data in Power Query ("Transform data" on the Home tab), renaming columns, changing columns' data type etc. and bring the columns into a format suitable for visualisation.

Finally, I visualise the data as an interactive 3-page dashboard in PowerBI. I also export a static version of the dashboard as a PDF.

Project Aim
Portfolio Project 1 - SQL and PowerBI - AdventureWorks

Welcome to my first portfolio project. In this project, I focus on data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using the AdventureWorks dataset. I begin by cleaning the dataset with SQL, then create an interactive 3-page dashboard in PowerBI. Additionally, I export a static version of the dashboard as a PDF.
